# Principles of Data Science Capstone Project



## Project Description: 
* Using a dataset of 52,000 songs from Spotify, I analyzed the relationships between song features and popularity, tested hypotheses on how these features influence popularity, and applied dimensionality reduction to predict key musical attributes.

### Features Analyzed
The dataset includes 10 key song attributes:
- **Duration**
- **Danceability**
- **Energy**
- **Loudness**
- **Speechiness**
- **Acousticness**
- **Instrumentalness**
- **Liveness**
- **Valence**
- **Tempo**

### Analysis Performed
- **Feature Distribution Analysis:** Histograms with normal distribution overlays to visualize data distributions
- **Examining Correlations:** Examining relationships between song length, explicit rating, energy, and other factors.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Using linear regression to determine the best predictor of popularity
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Identifying most meaningful and predictive song features.
- **Classification (Logistic Regression):** Predicting whether a song is in a major or minor key.
