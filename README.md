# Principles of Data Science Capstone Project



## Project Description: 
* Using a set of 52,000 songs from Spotify, I conducted an analysis to better understand what features of songs tends to make them more popular, test hypotheses relating to the affect of these features on popularity, and reduce dimensionality of song features to predict key musical attributes.

### Features Analyzed
The dataset includes 10 key song attributes:
- **Duration**
- **Danceability**
- **Energy**
- **Loudness**
- **Speechiness**
- **Acousticness**
- **Instrumentalness**
- **Liveness**
- **Valence**
- **Tempo**

### Analysis Performed
- **Feature Distribution Analysis:** Histograms with normal distribution overlays to visualize data distributions
- **Examining Correlations:** Examining relationships between song length, explicit rating, energy, and other factors.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Using linear regression to determine the best predictor of popularity
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Identifying most meaningful and predictive song features.
- **Classification (Logistic Regression):** Predicting whether a song is in a major or minor key.
